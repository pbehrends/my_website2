# Homework 2 Challenge 1

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"


#Admission to ICU
covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
